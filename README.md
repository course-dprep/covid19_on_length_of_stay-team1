# Covid-19 Impact on length of stay Airbnb in Amsterdam

What is the impact of Covid19 on the minimum days of stay in Amsterdam?


## Motivation
The Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the tourism industry globally, with a significant decrease in travel and accommodation bookings. Airbnb, a popular platform for short-term rentals, has also been affected by the pandemic. Many cities around the world have experienced a sharp decline in Airbnb bookings due to travel restrictions and safety concerns. However, there may be some cities that have been less impacted by the pandemic in terms of Airbnb bookings. Identifying these cities and understanding the factors that contributed to their resilience is an important research topic that can provide valuable insights for the tourism industry, policymakers and Airbnb hosts. Therefore our research question is: Which cities (probably specific country) was least impacted by Covid-19 and why could this have been the case?
