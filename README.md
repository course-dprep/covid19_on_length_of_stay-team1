# Covid-19 Impact on length of stay Airbnb in Amsterdam

*What is the impact of COVID-19 on the minimum days of stay in Airbnb rooms in Amsterdam?*


## Motivation
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the travel and tourism industry, with many countries implementing travel restrictions and lockdown measures to control the spread of the virus. Amsterdam, as a popular tourist destination, has been affected by these measures, with a sharp decline in the number of visitors to the city. This has had a ripple effect on the hospitality industry, including the rental market for Airbnb rooms.

The research question *"What is the impact of Covid-19 on the minimum days of stay in Airbnb rooms in Amsterdam?"* is important to investigate as it addresses a gap in our understanding of how the pandemic has affected the short-term rental market in the city. The minimum days of stay is an important metric for understanding the rental market, as it reflects both supply and demand for short-term accommodation. By examining how the minimum days of stay have changed during the pandemic, we can gain insight into how the rental market has adapted to the new reality of travel restrictions and social distancing measures.
Besides, there is a contradictory literature towards the affects of COVID-19 on the minimum nights per stay.A recent article in the New York Times has presented data suggesting that minimum night requirements for Airbnb stays in New York City were significantly higher during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to after the pandemic. However, Kourtit et al., have put forward a different perspective, suggesting that minimum night requirements actually decreased during the pandemic as hosts reduced these requirements to encourage more bookings. As such, there is a need to conduct further research to ascertain the true effect of COVID-19 on minimum night requirements. To address this research gap, an investigation will be conducted on an European city, as existing studies have primarily focused on the United States.We choose Amsterdam as an example of an European city since we all are Dutch inhabitants.
